# Welcome to my blog !

My name is François Desaulle, I am a 22 years old French graduate from the University of Warwick in the UK. 

I am currently finishing a 3 months course in Data Science and AI, as such, I have decided to create this blog to share some of my Data Science projects, I hope you'll find it interesting ! 

Outside of Data Science, my interests are:

- Traveling: I have been lucky to travel to amazing places over the past years such as Australia, South Africa, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, just to name a few...  I recently spent a year in Hong Kong where I studied for a semester before starting an intership in digital marketing at Pernod Ricard Asia. I used this time in Hong Kong to travel in South East Asia. I visited Bali, went multiple times to China, traveled through Cambodia for a week on my own, visited Seoul and ended up exploring the East Australian Coast for a month in July 2019.

- Sports: I have been playing football since I was 5, I played for my neighborhood team in my teenage years and made into Warwick's University Football Team during my studies. I also practice Fitness/Crossfit, play tennis and also practiced Judo from 6 to 16 years. I am a scuba diving fanatic, I got my scuba diving license when I was 11 years old and still dive today, I used my time in Australia to dive a couple of times on the Great Barrier Reef and also did an amazing dive with Grey Nurse Shark near Byron Bay.
